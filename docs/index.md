# Volumetric Data Visualization in VR

### Done By : Gaurav Ajay Bhokare
### Release Date : 13/12/2021
### Platforms : WebGL, Vrduino


## Project Abstract:
- Volumetric data like medical images can be very critically understood when seen in VR view i.e in an immersive environment. This project is an attempt to create a program and associated HMD hardware from scratch to do this task. This project works in phases and the works through each fundamental step. 

- There are many advanced softwares and AR/VR projects which do a stunning job of representing medical images to its finest detail and are helping many doctors in the disease diagnosis process.

- Goal of my project is to replicate a tiny version of these grand projects by implementing crucial parts of software and hardware.

- Inspiration for this project comes from the Image processing class which teaches a lot of processing algorithms which are generic and applicable to 3D data.

## Project Features:

1. Cube Marching: The most fundamental algorithm to render a volumetric data.

2. Stereoscopic unwrapping: This is the gateway to take a rendered image into the VR environment.

3. Analyzing data: The HMD has a mounted IMU which provides user head movement inputs and accordingly the rendered data is updated.

## About:

- This idea of medical image process was an inspiration from the image process class which showcased analysis of 2D images through various algorithms and hinted on the fact that 3D data processing is full of opportunities.


-  This project is an attempt to understand Will Usher's implementation of cube marching and adapt it to VR environment.
